[User Story Definition of Ready]
A story is created and agreed upon with input from the Project Owner. The team comes to an understanding of the criteria needed for the
story, a rough idea of the length of time to complete the story and what tests will need to be performed once the story is complete.

[User Story Definition of Done]
The User Story has been prioritized by the Product Owner and is entered into the upcoming sprint. It is coded by the development team per
the User Story criteria and is passed on to be fully tested and verified by the Testers. If the Testers give the okay the User Story is
ready for release.
